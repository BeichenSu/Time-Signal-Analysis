Abstract A pratice emphiasize on denoise a nosiy moving signal of 3D by averaging white noise and gaussian filter.

You dog Fluffy swallowed a marble. The vet suspects that it has now worked its way into the intestines. Using ultrasound, data is obtained concerning the spatial variations in a small area of the intestines where the marble is suspected to be. Unfortunately, fluffy keeps moving and the internal fluid movement through the intestines generates highly noisy data. With a testdata contains 20 rows of data for 20 different measurements that were taken in time. We tackle the problem by following steps:

Through averaging of the spectrum, determine the frequency signature (center frequency) generated by the marble.
Filter the data around the center frequency determined above in order to denoise the data and determine the path of the marble. (use plot3 to plot the path once you have it)
Find the position where should an intense acoustic wave be focused to breakup the marble at the 20th data measurement.
