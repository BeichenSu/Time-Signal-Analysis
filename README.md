Abstract
A pratice emphiasize on denoise a nosiy moving signal of 3D by averaging white noise and gaussian filter.

You dog Fluffy swallowed a marble. The vet suspects that it has now worked
its way into the intestines. Using ultrasound, data is obtained concerning
the spatial variations in a small area of the intestines where the marble is
suspected to be. Unfortunately, fluffy keeps moving and the internal fluid
movement through the intestines generates highly noisy data.
With a testdata contains 20 rows of data for 20 different measurements that
were taken in time. We tackle the problem by following steps:
1. Through averaging of the spectrum, determine the frequency signature
(center frequency) generated by the marble.
2. Filter the data around the center frequency determined above in order to
denoise the data and determine the path of the marble. (use plot3 to plot
the path once you have it)
3. Find the position where should an intense acoustic wave be focused to
breakup the marble at the 20th data measurement.
